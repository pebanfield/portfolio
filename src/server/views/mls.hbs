    <p>This application was
    a version two enhancement for the Windows 8 Major League Soccer application. The application 
    consumed data from a remote data service and displayed scores, articles and videos.
    During this project I quickly learned  
    I performed the work with a development team at Pop Media as a senior contracting consultant 
    working for Robert Half Technologies. I was impressed with the quality and efficiency of project

    short development time of 6 weeks. <img alt="MLS Win8" src="/img/mls1.jpg"></img><br/>
